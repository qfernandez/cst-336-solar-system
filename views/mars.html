        <p> Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in the Solar System and the second-smallest solid planet. 
        Mars is a cold terrestrial planet with polar ice caps of frozen water and carbon dioxide.
        It has the largest volcano in the Solar System, and some very large impact craters.
        Mars is named after the mythological Roman god of war because it appears of red color.</p>
